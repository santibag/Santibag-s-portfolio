The files uploaded to this repo are free to use, change and distribute if I didn't say otherwise.
They're usually small projects and I don't get anything by making them but learning to program.

If I make a big project that I want to restrict it's usage, I will make another lisence file for it.
This restriction is in terms of changes and distribution without permission.
